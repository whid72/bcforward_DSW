# Design
For this assessment, I decided to go with a singleton approach. The singleton contains the neccessary functionality to retrieve, organize, and display the data.

# Logic
With functional programming, I created various methods to manipulate the data. After retrieveing, I simply broke the data.txt file down into individual arrays containg strings. These strings allowed me to create types and products. At this point, I built methods to arrange the products in their respective categories to begin retrieving the min and max values to be displayed. Once the variables were populated, I used string concatenation to get the desired output for the user to review.
